# TLS and SSH Downgrade Attacks and protections

This paper was made during my studies in Germany, at the school Hochschule Albstadt-Sigmaringen. In this repository, you will find the LaTeX code of the paper and the paper as a PDF. It was an interesting topic to learn more about cybersecurity. I used the [LaTeX template from TCHES](https://github.com/Cryptosaurus/iacrtrans).
